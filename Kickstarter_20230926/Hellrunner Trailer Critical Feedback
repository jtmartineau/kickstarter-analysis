Notes from Mommie's critical feedback on Hellrunner
	1. Initially she suggested that there should be more action in the beginning.
	2. She really liked it visually. She said it was beautiful.
	3. She could not tell that the head in the sink was a head until the second watch through.

Notes from Hannah's critical feedback on Hellrunner
	1. Exact plot is not clear: are you in Hell or are you in outerspace? However she did get the outline of it right.
	2. She said there was too much going on visually. It was hard for her to keep track of everything going on.
	3. She didn't like the vhs scan lines in game (I'm probably going to keep these unless I hear the same thing from a lot of people)
	4. The said the brightness made it hard to keep track of everything. She said it seemed very bright to her.
	   it seemed too desaturated.
        5. She said she was high when she watched it so that detracts from what she was saying somewhat.
